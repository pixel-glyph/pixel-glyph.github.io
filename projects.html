              <p>For a while now I’ve wanted to design a site for a local business sorely in need of a new one. While the Village Gate Square is more of an urban mall with a mix of residential units and commercial offices attached than it is a single business, I decided it to be an appropriate candidate for a <a href="http://www.villagegatesquare.com/" target="_blank">much needed </a>redesign, especially considering it serves as a hub for a number of hip new businesses and restaurants.</p>

              <p>I wanted to make the home page a bit more flashy than the other pages on the site so it’s the one I’m showcasing here; a few others are currently being worked on.</p>

              <p>For this project I used Jade, Sass, and a bit of JavaScript with jQuery for some parallax effects and scrolling events. Though I built the header to appear when scrolling up and hide when scrolling down, I realize that it’s probably not as ideal as a simple fixed header—but I was up for the challenge of creating it!</p>

              <p>The idea for this app grew from the need to check weather in various towns whenever going on a road trip, especially in winter to avoid traveling through snow storms. Simply put, CommuteCast is a Google Maps canvas that functions much like Google Maps with the addition of weather reporting along any route and for whatever day the user inputs.</p>

              <p>CommuteCast uses several Google Maps APIs to calculate and draw a route with a given start and destination and then grabs and stores latitude and longitude coordinates along appropriately-spaced intervals of the route, which are calculated based on the route’s total distance. These coordinates, along with the date the user selects, are sent to Forecast.io and the weather at each point is retrieved. Based on the data returned, CommuteCast will select from a pool of <a href="https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons" target="_blank">weather icons</a> I’ve included in the project and paint the appropriate depiction at each point on the map where the weather is being reported. Hovering over these icons will reveal the expected temperatures for that day as well as more info on weather conditions.</p>

              <p>I built this app before getting into task runners, preprocessors, and other handy technologies such as Browserify (which explains the multiple script calls in the markup), but I’ve since moved on to leveraging more tools and structuring projects more efficiently.</p>

              <p>I did, however, decide to try out Bootstrap on this app—mostly for the mobile dropdown menu, but also to get acquainted with the framework.</p>

              <p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading: I have what many might call a harmless obsession with books. So, naturally, I built a reading list application.</p>

              <p>This app presents the user with two lists, one for books they wish to read and one for books they’ve recently finished reading. Clicking the plus icon at the top of the “To Read” list brings up a modal where the user can perform a search. The app uses Google Books for the search, retrieving a thumbnail image of the book’s cover as well as covers of other books by the same author for the user to choose from. Once a selection is made, the chosen thumbnail along with the proper title and author are grabbed and written to the list. Currently the app utilizes the browser’s local storage to save a user’s created lists.</p>

              <p>LitList is simple—perhaps a bit too simple. But that’s because it’s far from a complete app. Future plans include a redesign and additional functionality such as drag-and-drop list sorting and user profile creation that allows for note taking, goal setting, and progress tracking.</p>

              <p>LitList is one of my earlier web projects. I wrote it using good old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no tools whatsoever (if I don’t count jQuery). Some time after the initial build, I went back and refactored some of the code and incorporated the build system I currently use.</p>
