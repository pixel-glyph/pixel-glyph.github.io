        <h3>Greetings!</h3>
        <p>I'm Andrew. Welcome to my site!</p>

        <br>
        <em>A Bit About Me:</em>

        <p>I have a tendency to want to learn everything. Whether the subject is Astrophysics or Medieval History, chances are I’m interested in knowing more. Luckily I’m able to hone my time and attention on a limited number of hobbies and interests, some of which, aside from coding, include reading, board games, coffee brewing, biking, and running.</p>

        <p>Several years ago I graduated college with a 4-year degree in humanities. The main focus of this education was Literature, but I had the opportunity to study various other artforms and came to greatly admire and appreciate the value of art in general.</p>

        <br>
        <em>So...web development?</em>

        <p>Like a lot of kids who grew up playing video games, I’m a bit of a tech nerd. As a teenager I had an intense interest in understanding computer hardware. I read a couple books on how computers worked and hacked around with my parent’s PCs until I was old enough to afford parts and build my own.</p>

        <p>Some years ago, a wise engineer friend of mine suggested I take up programming after expressing an interest in how software worked. Being a sucker for learning new things, I began studying some basic HTML and CSS. Shortly afterwards I returned to college for two more years to complete a general IT/CS degree. That’s when I really started to love coding.</p>

        <p>What draws me to the front end of web development is that it’s an intersection of creativity and real logical problem solving. In high school I was the oddball who enjoyed the challenge of complex Math problems. I grew up playing chess and puzzle games like Myst. When the Rubik’s cube made a comeback years ago, I spent hours learning how to solve it. Needless to say, I enjoy solving problems—but I also have a great admiration for various types of art, including visual design. Front end web development, for me, is the best of both worlds!</p>

        <br>
        <em>That being said…</em>

        <p>I’m currently looking to join a team of energetic, knowledgeable, and ever-curious developers. I’ve got a solid handle on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the moment I enjoy supplementing projects with Jade, Sass, jQuery and Gulp. I’m somewhat familiar with Angular, I’m good friends with Git and the OS X/Linux command line, and I’m no stranger to Python or Java—over the last few years I’ve worked on various projects in both languages.</p>
