          <h3>Greetings!</h3>
          <p>I'm Andrew. Welcome to my site!</p>
          <p>I’m a highly self-motivated Front End Developer with an eye for detail and a strict adherence to standards and clean code. I’ve been programming for five years, three of which have been spent developing for the web. I’ve worked extensively with JavaScript, getting to know its quirks and nuances. I’ve come to appreciate the language’s functional paradigm as well as its potential in today’s modern web. Though I’ve spent a considerable amount of time working with jQuery, I prefer avoiding it whenever possible as its usefulness is ever-diminishing. Some frameworks and tools I do enjoy leveraging include React, Sass, Jade, Gulp, Babel, Node.js, and Git.</p>
          <p>What draws me to the front end of web development is the balance of creativity and logical problem solving that the work entails. In 2008 I earned a BA in Humanities with a focus on Literature; I have a deep admiration for writing and other art forms. At the same time, I’ve always harbored a bent towards mathematics and problem solving; I love the challenge of a good puzzle—whether it’s tracking down elusive bugs in a codebase, penciling in a crossword, or playing through point-and-click adventure games like Myst. For me, front end web development offers the best of both worlds!</p>
