          <h3>Greetings!</h3>

          <p>I'm Andrew. Welcome to my site!</p>

          <p>Looking to join an energetic, knowledgeable, and ever-curious team, I am a highly self-motivated developer with an eye for detail and a strict adherence to standards and clean code. Despite my limited on-the-job experience, I have a thorough understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m somewhat familiar with Angular, good friends with Git and the OS X/Linux command line, and no stranger to Python or Java. Some of the tools I enjoy implementing include Jade, Sass, Babel, jQuery, and Gulp.</p>

          <br>
          <em class="subheading"><strong>A Bit About Me:</strong></em>

          <p>I have a tendency to want to learn everything. Whether the subject is Astrophysics or Medieval History, chances are I’m interested in knowing more. As a result I have a good number of hobbies and interests, some of which, aside from coding, include reading, board games, coffee brewing, biking, and running.</p>

          <p>In 2008 I graduated college with a degree in humanities. The main focus of this education was Literature, but I had the chance to study various other artforms and came to greatly admire and appreciate the value of art in general.</p>

          <br>
          <em class="subheading"><strong>So...Web Development?</strong></em>

          <p>I’ve always been a bit of a tech nerd. As a kid I would take apart calculators and video game controllers in an attempt to understand how these gadgets worked. In my teens I read books on computer hardware and hacked around with my parent’s PCs until I was old enough to afford parts and build my own.</p>

          <p>Some years after college, a wise engineer friend of mine, who knew I was into tech and enjoyed creating things, suggested I take up programming. Since I love to learn, little time passed before I began studying some Java basics. Soon enough I returned to college and finished a 2 year IT/CS degree. That’s when I really got hooked on coding.</p>

          <p>What draws me to the front end of web development is that it’s an intersection of creativity and real logical problem solving. In high school I was the oddball who enjoyed the challenge of complex math problems. I grew up playing chess and point-and-click puzzle games like Myst. When the Rubik’s cube made a comeback years ago, I spent hours learning how to solve it. Needless to say, I enjoy solving problems—but I also have a great admiration for various types of art, including visual design. Front end web development, for me, offers the best of both worlds!</p>
